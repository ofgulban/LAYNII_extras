# PyLAYNII (work in progress...)
Just a project for self-education. Looking at [LAYNII](https://github.com/layerfMRI/LAYNII) source code and implementing some parts of it in python. I am not aiming for direct translation but I am aiming for getting similar results by reimplementing the main concepts. I am going to keep the command line interface and naming conventions as similar as possible for people who are already using [LAYNII](https://github.com/layerfMRI/LAYNII).

If you think this project is redundant while [LAYNII](https://github.com/layerfMRI/LAYNII) exists, it is. I do it because I can. Also, I think the much shorter python code (compared to C++) can be a good educational material in the future.
