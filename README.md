# LayNii_extras (work in progress...)

Here are some extra scripts that we use in combination with [LayNii](https://github.com/layerfMRI/LAYNII).

These are mostly Python or Bash scripts. We do not commit to maintain these rigorously but collecting them here to benefit our users.

### For using `image_to_nifti.py`
If you have Python installed on your PC, do:
```
pip install numpy scipy nibabel opencv
```
or if you are using conda (anaconda or miniconda):
```
conda install numpy scipy nibabel opencv
```
